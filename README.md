## Using

`consul-ssh` needs to know where Consul's API is, this can be configured using the `CONSUL_URL` environment variable or the `--url` command line flag.
Run `consul-ssh -h` for a complete list of flags.

```
consul-ssh ssh --service=my_awesome_service --tag=some_tag --username=joe
```
`--username` is optional of course

To list the node for service and tag:

```
consul-ssh query --service=my_awesome_service --tag=some_tag
```
